## For your tools, learning, development, etc., I hope GitHub won't let me down. I'm just sharing for those who struggle and need help.

## This is important to read and follow!
1. Before you click any link, make sure you have [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) on your PC/Laptop as well as on your Chrome browser for your own safety.
2. Do not use your personal/work Gmail account or anything important to you. Instead, use a throwaway account. Do not enter personal data such as your first name, last name, etc.
3. If you have trust issues, kindly go to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url) and [ScamAdviser](https://www.scamadviser.com/) to scan or check the website for safety. Do your research because I'm too lazy to check them all. I believe it's safe, but don't rely on me; verify it yourself for your own safety. Awareness is important.
4. Not everything is free because there is a limit. Some websites don't allow us to delete our account, so just leave it as long as you don't use sensitive data.
5. Be mindful. That's all.

   I do not have time to add descriptions to every link because my health is not good day and night.
